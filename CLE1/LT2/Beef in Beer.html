<h1>Ingredients</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap)</li>
        <li>500 mls of real ale</li>
        <li>4 large onions</li>
        <li>2 fat cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>tbsp of plain flour</li>
     
    </ul>
<h1>Methods</h1>    
    
    
    <p>1) Raw beef, roll it in the flour... fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal... put to one side when all done.</p>
    <p>2) Cut the onions into quarters... fry in the same frying pan as the beef... to soak up the juices...</p>
    <p>3) Towards the end of frying the onion (they should nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic.</p>
    <p>4) Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour.</p>
    <p>5) Pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted!</p>
    <p>6) Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours... will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me serve with mash.</p>
